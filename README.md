# Codeshr

An Instant Text Sharing Utility

> ⭐ __Сodeshr__ was meant to be __more than__ just an instant __text__ sharing utility. Since __text is__ essentially __a file__, we decided to __pursue__ the natural extension of this project to just [__shr__](https://github.com/haqa-ru/shr/)

## Features

Import the text and instantly get the url to share
